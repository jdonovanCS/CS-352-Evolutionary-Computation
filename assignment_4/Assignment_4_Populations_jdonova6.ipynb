    "As we beging to work with populations, it will get a increasingly messy to keep track of each individual's genome and fitness seperately as they move around the population and through generational time. To help simplify this, let's implement each individual within a population as an instance of an `Individual` class.  To start, this class will be quite simple and will just be an object which has attributes for both the individual's `genome` and its `fitness`.  Since we will only be using fitness functions that depend on a single individual in this assignment, let's also implement an `eval_fitness` for each individual that will evaluate and update its stored fitness value when called."

As mentioned in class, tournament selection is one of my go-to methods for parent selection, so let's implement it here.  The tournament should rely on input parameters such as the `tournament_size` to determine how many solutions will compete in a given tournament or  `num_tournament_winners` to determine how many individuals from each tournament will be selected to move on as parents of the next generation.  Touraments can be selected from the population with or without replacement (specifically I'm referring to making sure all individuals appear in at least one tournament before any individual partakes in one for a second time), and here feel free to use whichever version is simpler for you to implement and understand (which I expect will be the case with replacement).
